<h1>Hobbies &amp; interests</h1>
<p>
	Outside of work, I have a keen interest in music and sound, both as a producer
	and engineer, and as part of an audience, and I also enjoy other creative pursuits
	(photography, design, writing, and so on). I'm reasonably active and sociable,
	and I regularly attend gigs at local venues to see both large well-known and new
	unsigned acts alike.

<p>
	I generally have several personal projects in progress at
	any time, to exercise different interests and skillsâ€”often mixing creative,
	strategic and technical approaches to solving problems and bringing ideas
	to life.
